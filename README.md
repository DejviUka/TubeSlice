# YouTube Downloader & Cutter

This project provides a command-line tool to download and cut YouTube videos. It uses **yt-dlp** to download videos (or extract audio) and **FFmpeg** to cut the media file. The tool supports specifying start and end times (or clip length) for cutting the downloaded media. This repository also includes a starter batch file to create a Python virtual environment and install required dependencies.

---

## Files Overview

- **ytDL.py**  
  The main Python script that:
  - Downloads YouTube videos using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
  - Supports three download modes:
    - **Audio only:** Extracts and saves the audio as an MP3 file.
    - **Video only:** Downloads video without audio.
    - **Video + Audio:** Downloads and merges the best video and audio streams into an MP4.
  - Cuts a segment of the downloaded file based on specified start (`-s`), end (`-e`), or length (`-l`) arguments.
  - Uses **FFmpeg** (via subprocess calls) for precise media cutting.

- **starter.bat**  
  A Windows batch script that:
  - Checks for an existing Python virtual environment (`venv`) and creates it if missing.
  - Activates the virtual environment.
  - Upgrades pip and installs all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Keeps the command prompt open with the virtual environment active.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Contains the Python package dependencies:
yt-dlp moviepy

These packages are used by `ytDL.py` for downloading videos and processing media files.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+** (recommended Python 3.8+)
- **FFmpeg** installed and added to your system's PATH  
Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/) if it is not already installed.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
 cd your-repository
Run the Starter Batch File (Windows):

Double-click starter.bat or run it from a command prompt to:

Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

Upgrade pip.

Install required Python packages from requirements.txt.

Alternatively, you can manually create the virtual environment and install dependencies:

bat
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
call venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
With the virtual environment activated, you can run the script using Python.

Command-Line Options
bash
Copy
Edit
python ytDL.py <YouTube URL> [options]
Positional Argument:

<YouTube URL>: URL of the YouTube video.

Optional Flags:

-a: Download audio only (extracts audio as MP3).

-v: Download video only (no audio).

-s mm.ss: Set the start time for cutting (in mm.ss format, e.g., 01.30 for 1 minute 30 seconds).

-e mm.ss: Set the end time for cutting.

-l mm.ss: Set the length of the clip; must be used with either -s or -e (cannot be used when both are provided).

-n output_filename: Specify the output file name (default is out.mp4).

Note: You cannot use both -a (audio only) and -v (video only) simultaneously.

Examples
Audio Only Clip (from 1:00 to 2:00):

bash
Copy
Edit
python ytDL.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -a -s 01.00 -e 02.00 -n audio_clip.mp4
Video + Audio Clip (from 1:00 to 2:00):

bash
Copy
Edit
python ytDL.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -s 01.00 -e 02.00 -n video_clip.mp4
Additional Notes
FFmpeg Requirement:
This script uses FFmpeg for cutting the downloaded media. Ensure that FFmpeg is installed and accessible via your system's PATH.

Virtual Environment:
The provided starter.bat simplifies setting up the virtual environment on Windows. For other platforms, follow your platformâ€™s standard procedures for creating and activating Python virtual environments.

Error Handling:
The script provides error messages for issues such as download failures, invalid time parameters, or file processing errors. Please review the console output for troubleshooting.

Updating Dependencies:
To update dependencies, activate your virtual environment and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp moviepy
